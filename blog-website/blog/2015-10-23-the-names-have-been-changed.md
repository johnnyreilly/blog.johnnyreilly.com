...to protect my wallet.

 Subsequent to this blog getting [a proper domain name a year ago](<http://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2014/12/whats-in-a-name.html>) it's now got a new one. That's right, `blog.icanmakethiswork.io` is dead! Long live `blog.johnnyreilly.com`!

There's nothing particularly exciting about this, it's more that `.io` domain names are *wayyyyy* expensive. And also I noticed that johnnyreilly.com was available. By an accident of history I've ended up either being johnny\_reilly or johnnyreilly online. ("johnreilly@hotmail.com" was already taken back in 2000 and "johnny\_reilly@hotmail.com" was available. I've subsequently become [@johnny\_reilly](<https://twitter.com/johnny_reilly>) on Twitter, [johnnyreilly](<https://github.com/johnnyreilly>) on GitHub so I guess you could say it's stuck.)

So I thought I'd kill 2 birds with one stone and make the switch. I've set up a redirect on [blog.icanmakethiswork.io](<http://blog.icanmakethiswork.io>) and so, anyone who goes to the old site should be 301'd over here. At least until my old domain name expires. Last time it'll change I promise. Well.... until next time anyway...
