description: 'Full stack developer John Reilly seeks new work after finishing recent contract. 15 years’ experience includes telecoms, advertising, tech and finance.'
---

My name is John Reilly. I'm a full stack developer based in London, UK. I'm just coming to the end of a contract (due to finish in April 2017) and I'm starting to look for my next role.

<!--truncate-->

I have more than 15 years experience developing software commercially. I've worked in a number of industries including telecoms, advertising, technology (I worked at Microsoft for a time) and, of course, finance. The bulk of my experience is in the finance sector. I've provided consultancy services, building and maintaining applications for both large and small companies; from enterprise to startup.

My most recent work has been full stack web work; using React on the front end and SignalR (ASP.Net) on the back end. I'm pragmatic about the tools that I use to deliver software solutions and not tied to any particular technology. That said, I've gravitated towards the handiwork of [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg); starting out with Delphi and being both an early C# and TypeScript adopter. I've built everything from high volume trade feeds with no UI beyond a log file, WinForms apps for call centres, to fully fledged rich web applications with a heavy emphasis on UX.

I enjoy the challenges of understanding problems and coming up with useful solutions to them. I'm thrilled when something I've built makes someone's life easier. I love to learn and to share my knowledge; both in person and also through writing this blog. (This is the first time I've used a post to seek work.)

In my spare time I'm involved with various open source projects including [ts-loader](https://github.com/typestrong/ts-loader) and [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) ([member of the core team](https://github.com/orgs/DefinitelyTyped/people)). Get in contact with me if you're interested in learning more about me. Mail me at [johnny_reilly@hotmail.com](mailto:johnny_reilly@hotmail.com) and I can provide you with a CV. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnnyreilly).

## Updated 25/04/2016: Position Filled

I'm happy to say that I've lined up work for the next 6 months or so. Once again I'll be working in the financial services industry with one interesting twist. [In a blog post ages ago I bet that native apps would start to be replaced with SPAs.](../2014-02-12-wpf-and-mystic-meg-or-playing/index.md) This has started to happen. I've started to see companies taking a "web-first-and-only" approach to building apps. In that vein, that's exactly what I'm off to build.

As a result of publishing this blog post I've had some interesting conversations with companies and got to think hard about the direction the industry is taking. I remain excited by JavaScript / TypeScript and React. I'm hopeful of the possibilities offered by the container world of Docker etc. I'm enjoying .NET Core and have very high hopes for it. I remain curious about Web Assembly.

Before I sign off, I know at some point I'll be looking for work once again. If there's a system you'd like built, if there's some mentoring and training you'd like done or if you'd just like to have a conversation I'm always available to talk. Drop me a line at [johnny_reilly@hotmail.com](mailto:johnny_reilly@hotmail.com).
