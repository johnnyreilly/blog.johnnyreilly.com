Like pretty much everyone else I've been using PhantomJS to run my JavaScript (or compiled-to-JS) unit tests. It's been great. So when I heard the news that [PhantomJS was dead](<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14105489>) I was genuinely sad. However, the King is dead.... Long live the King! For there is a new hope; it's called [Chrome Headless ](<https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>). It's not a separate version of Chrome; rather the ability to run Chrome without a UI is now baked into Google's favourite browser as of v59. (For those history buffs I might as well be clear: the main reason PhantomJS died is because Chrome Headless was in the works.)

 ## Making the Switch

As long as you're running Chrome v59 or greater then you can switch. I've just made ts-loader's execution test pack run with Chrome Headless instead of PhantomJS and I've rarely been happier. Honest. Some context: the execution test pack runs Jasmine unit tests via the [Karma test runner](<https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html>). The move was surprisingly easy and you can see just how minimal it was in the PR [here](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/611/files>). If you want to migrate a test that runs tests via Karma then this will take you through what you need to do.

## `package.json`

You no longer need `phantomjs-prebuilt` as a dev dependency of your project. That's the PhantomJS browser disappearing in the rear view mirror. Next we need to replace `karma-phantomjs-launcher` with `karma-chrome-launcher`. These packages are responsible for firing up the browser that the tests are run in and we no longer want to invoke PhantomJS; we're Chrome all the way baby.

## `karma.conf.js`

You need to tell Karma to use Chrome Headless instead of PhantomJS. You do that by replacing

```js
browsers: [ 'PhantomJS' ],
```

with

```js
browsers: [ 'ChromeHeadless' ],
```

That's it; job done!

## Continuous Integration

There's always one more thing isn't there? Yup, ts-loader has CI builds that run on [Windows with AppVeyor](<https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JohnReilly/ts-loader/branch/master>) and [Linux with Travis](<https://travis-ci.org/TypeStrong/ts-loader>). The AppVeyor build went green on the first run; that's because Chrome is installed by default in the AppVeyor build environment. (yay!)

Travis went red. (boooo!) Travis doesn't have Chrome installed by default. But it's no biggie; you just need to tweak your `.travis.yml` like so:

```yml
dist: trusty
addons:
  chrome: stable
```

This includes Chrome in the Travis build environment. Green. Boom!
