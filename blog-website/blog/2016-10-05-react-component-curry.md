Everyone loves curry don't they? I don't know about you but I'm going for one on Friday.

 When React 0.14 shipped, it came with a new way to write React components. Rather than as an ES2015 class or using `React.createClass` there was now another way: stateless functional components.

These are components which have no state (the name gives it away) and a simple syntax; they are a function which takes your component props as a single parameter and they return JSX. Think of them as the render method of a standard component just with props as a parameter.

The advantage of these components is that they can reduce the amount of code you have to write for a component which requires no state. This is even more true if you're using ES2015 syntax as you have arrow functions and destructuring to help.Embrace the terseness!

There is another advantage of this syntax. If you have a number of components which share similar implementation you can easily make component factories by currying:

```jsx
function iconMaker(fontAwesomeClassName: string) {
   return props => <i className={ `fa ${ fontAwesomeClassName }` }/>;
}

const ThumbsUpIcon = iconMaker("fa-thumbs-up");
const TrophyIcon = iconMaker("fa-trophy");

// Somewhere in else inside a render function:

<p>This is totally <ThumbsUpIcon />.... You should win a <TrophyIcon /></p>
```

So our `iconMaker` is a function which, when called with a [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) class name produces a function which, when invoked, will return a the HTML required to render that icon. This is a super simple example, a bhaji if you will, but you can imagine how useful this technique can be when you've more of a banquet in mind.
