The tremendous [Tanner Linsley](<https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley>) recently released [`react-virtual`](<https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-virtual>). `react-virtual` provides "hooks for virtualizing scrollable elements in React".

I was already using the (also excellent) [`react-window`](<https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window>) for this purpose. `react-window` does the virtualising job and does it very well indeed However, I was both intrigued by the lure of the new shiny thing. I've also never been the biggest fan of `react-window`'s API. So I tried switching over from `react-window` to `react-virtual` as an experiment. To my delight, the experiment went so well I didn't look back!

What did I get out of the switch?

- Simpler code / nicer developer ergonomics. The API for `react-virtual` allowed me to simplify my code and lose a layer of components. 
- TypeScript support in the box
- Improved perceived performance. I didn't run any specific tests to quantify this, but I can say that the same functionality now feels snappier.

I tweeted my delight at this and Tanner asked if there was commit diff I could share. I couldn't as it's a private codebase, but I thought it could form the basis of a blogpost.

 > Nice! Do you have a commit diff we could see?

In case you hadn't guessed, this is that blog post...

## Make that change

So what does the change look like? Well first remove `react-window` from your project:

```
yarn remove react-window @types/react-window
```

Add the dependency to `react-virtual`:

```
yarn add react-virtual
```

Change your imports from:

```ts
import { FixedSizeList, ListChildComponentProps } from 'react-window';
```

to:

```ts
import { useVirtual } from 'react-virtual';
```

Change your component code from:

```ts
type ImportantDataListProps = {
    classes: ReturnType<typeof useStyles>;
    importants: ImportantData[];
};

const ImportantDataList: React.FC<ImportantDataListProps> = React.memo(props => (
    <FixedSizeList
        height={400}
        width={'100%'}
        itemSize={80}
        itemCount={props.importants.length}
        itemData={props}
    >
        {RenderRow}
    </FixedSizeList>
));

type ListItemProps = {
    classes: ReturnType<typeof useStyles>;
    importants: ImportantData[];
};

function RenderRow(props: ListChildComponentProps) {
    const { index, style } = props;
    const { importants, classes } = props.data as ListItemProps;
    const important = importants[index];

    return (
        <ListItem button style={style} key={index}>
            <ImportantThing classes={classes} important={important} />
        </ListItem>
    );
}
```

Of the above you can delete the `ListItemProps` type and the associate `RenderRow` function. You won't need them again! There's no longer a need to pass down data to the child element and then extract it for usage; it all comes down into a single simpler component.

Replace the `ImportantDataList` component with this:

```ts
const ImportantDataList: React.FC<ImportantDataListProps> = React.memo(props => {
    const parentRef = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

    const rowVirtualizer = useVirtual({
        size: props.importants.length,
        parentRef,
        estimateSize: React.useCallback(() => 80, []), // This is just a best guess
        overscan: 5
    });

    return (
            <div
                ref={parentRef}
                style={{
                    width: `100%`,
                    height: `500px`,
                    overflow: 'auto'
                }}
            >
                <div
                    style={{
                        height: `${rowVirtualizer.totalSize}px`,
                        width: '100%',
                        position: 'relative'
                    }}
                >
                    {rowVirtualizer.virtualItems.map(virtualRow => (
                        <div
                            key={virtualRow.index}
                            ref={virtualRow.measureRef}
                            className={props.classes.hoverRow}
                            style={{
                                position: 'absolute',
                                top: 0,
                                left: 0,
                                width: '100%',
                                height: `${virtualRow.size}px`,
                                transform: `translateY(${virtualRow.start}px)`
                            }}
                        >
                            <ImportantThing
                                classes={props.classes}
                                important={props.importants[virtualRow.index]}
                            />
                        </div>
                    ))}
                </div>
            </div>
    );
});
```

And you are done! Thanks Tanner for this tremendous library!
