Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes of open source projects? One that I'm involved with is [ts-loader](<https://github.com/typestrong/ts-loader>); a TypeScript loader for webpack. Yesterday was an interesting day in the life of ts-loader and webpack; things unexpectedly broke. Oh and don't worry, they're fixed now.

 How things panned out reflects well on the webpack community. I thought it might be instructive to take a look at the legs furiously paddling underneath the duck of open source. What follows is a minute by minute account of my life on the afternoon of Wednesday 22nd February 2017:

### 3:55pm

 I'm sat at my desk in the City of London. I have to leave at 4pm to go to the dentist. I'm working away on a project which is built and bundled using ts-loader and webpack. However, having just npm installed and tried to spin up webpack in watch mode, I discover that everything is broken. Watch mode is not working - there's an error being thrown in ts-loader. It's to do with a webpack property called `mtimes`. ts-loader depends upon it and it looks like it is no longer always passed through. Go figure. ### 4:01pm

I've got to go. I'm 15 minutes from Bank station. So, I grab my bag and scarper out the door. On my phone I notice [an issue](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/479>) has been raised - other people are being affected by the problem too. As I trot down the various alleys that lead to the station I wonder whether I can work around this issue. Using GitHub to fork, edit code and submit a PR on a mobile phone is possible. Just. But it's certainly not easy...

[My PR is in](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/481>), the various test packs are starting to execute somewhere out there in Travis and Appveyor-land. Then I notice [Ed Bishop](<https://github.com/mredbishop>) has submitted a [near identical PR](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/480>). Yay Ed! I'm always keen to encourage people to contribute and so I intend to merge that PR rather than my own.

### 16:12

Rubbish. The Waterloo and City Line is out of action. I need to get across London to reach Waterloo or I'll miss my appointment. It's time to start running....

### 16:15

It's rather nagging at me that behaviour has changed without warning. This has been reliably in place the entire time I've been involved with ts-loader / webpack. Why now? I don't see any obvious mentions on the webpack GitHub repo. So I head over to the webpack Slack channel and ask: (conversation slightly abridged)

> Hey all, has something happened to `mtimes`? Behaviour seems to have changed - now undefined occasionally during watch mode. A PR has been raised against ts-loader to work around this [https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/480#issuecomment-281714600](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/480#issuecomment-281714600>)

> #### johnny\_reilly

>  Okay, I'm on a train and won't be near a computer for a while. ts-loader is presently broken because it depends on mtimes. Would it be possible for you to add this back at least for now. I'm aware many people depend on ts-loader and are now broken. #### sokra

>  @sokra is this the change you just made for that watchpack bug fix? Or unlrelated, just wanted to track if I didn't already have the change/issue #### sokra

> [https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/pull/48](<https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/pull/48>)

> ```js
> const watcher = watching.compiler.watchFileSystem.watcher || 
>                 watching.compiler.watchFileSystem.wfs.watcher
> ```
> 
> And then `.mtimes`
> 
> Should I be able to do `.getTimes()` instead?
> 
> #### sokra
> 
> actually you can't rely on `watchFileSystem` being `NodeJsWatchFileSystem`. But this is another topic

> Thanks @sokra - when I get to a keyboard I'll swap `mtimes` for `getTimes()` and report back.

### 17:28

Despite various trains being out of action / missing in action I've made it to the dentists; phew! I go in for my checkup and plan to take a look at the issue later that evening. In the meantime I've hoping that Tobias ([Sokra](<https://twitter.com/wsokra>)) will get chance to republish so that ts-loader users aren't too impacted.

### 18:00

Done at the dentist and I'm heading home. Whilst I've been opening wide and squinting at the ceiling, [TypeScript 2.2 has shipped](<https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2017/02/22/announcing-typescript-2-2/>). Whilst this is super exciting, according to Greenkeeper, [the new version has broken the build](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/483>). Arrrrghhhh...

I start to look into this and realise we're not broken because of TypeScript 2.2; we were broken because of the `mtimes`. Tobias has now re-added `mtimes` and published. With that in place I requeue a build and.... drum roll.... we're green!

The good news just keeps on coming as [Luka Zakrajšek](<https://twitter.com/bancek>) has submitted a [PR which uses `getTimes()` in place of `mtimes`](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/pull/482>). And the tests pass. Awesome! MERGE. I just need to cut a release and we're done.

### 18:15

I'm home. My youngest son has been suffering from chicken pox all week and as a result my wife has been in isolation, taking care of him. We chat whilst the boys watch Paw Patrol as the bath runs. I flick open the laptop and start doing the various housekeeping tasks around cutting a release. This is interrupted by various bathtime / bedtime activities and I abandon work for now.

### 19:30

The boys are down and I get on with the release; updating the changelog, bumping the version number and running the tests. For various reasons this takes longer than it normally does.

### 20:30

Finally we're there; ts-loader 2.0.1 ships: [https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/releases/tag/v2.0.1](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/releases/tag/v2.0.1>).

I'm tremendously grateful to everyone that helped out - thank you all!

> ts-loader 2.0.1 has shipped; thanks [@wsokra](<https://twitter.com/wSokra>)[@bancek](<https://twitter.com/bancek>) and @mredbishop [https://t.co/I00c7sJyFo](<https://t.co/I00c7sJyFo>)[\#typescript](<https://twitter.com/hashtag/typescript?src=hash>)
