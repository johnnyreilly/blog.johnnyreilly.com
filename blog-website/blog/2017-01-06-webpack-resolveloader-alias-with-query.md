Sometimes you write a post for the ages. Sometimes you write one you hope is out of date before you hit "publish". This is one of those.

 There's a [bug](<https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve/issues/41>) in webpack's enhanced-resolve. It means that you cannot configure an aliased loader using the `query` (or `options` in the webpack 2 nomenclature). Let me illustrate; consider the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        loader: 'ts-loader',
        query: {
            entryFileIsJs: true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

module.exports.resolveLoader = { alias: { 'ts-loader': require('path').join(__dirname, "../../index.js")
```

At the time of writing, if you alias a loader as above, then the `query` / `options` will \**not*\* be passed along. This is bad, particularly given the requirement in webpack 2 that configuration is no longer possible through extending the [`webpack.config.js`](<https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/#loader-configuration-is-through-options>). So what to do? Well, when this was a problem previously the marvellous [James Brantly](<https://www.twitter.com/jbrantly>) had a [workaround](<https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1289#issuecomment-125767499>). I've taken that and run with it:

```js
var config = {
  // ...
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        loader: 'ts-loader',
        query: {
          entryFileIsJs: true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

module.exports = config;

var loaderAliasPath = require('path').join(__dirname, "../../../index.js");
var rules = config.module.loaders || config.module.rules;
rules.forEach(function(rule) {
  var options = rule.query || rule.options;
  rule.loader = rule.loader.replace('ts-loader', loaderAliasPath + (options ? '?' + JSON.stringify(options) : ''));
});
```

This approach stringifies the `query` / `options` and suffixes it to the aliased path. This works as long as the options you're passing are JSON-able (yes it's a word).

As I said earlier; hopefully by the time you read this the workaround will no longer be necessary again. But just in case....
