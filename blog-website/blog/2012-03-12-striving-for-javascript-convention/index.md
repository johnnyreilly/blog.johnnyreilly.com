## Update

<!--truncate-->

The speed of change makes fools of us all. Since I originally wrote this post all of 3 weeks ago Visual Studio 11 beta has been released and the issues I was seeking to solve have pretty much been resolved by the new innovations found therein. It's nicely detailed in [@carlbergenhem](http://www.twitter.com/carlbergenhem)'s blog post: [My Top 5 Visual Studio 11 Designer Improvements for ASP.NET 4.5 Development](https://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/posts/12-03-26/my-top-5-visual-studio-11-designer-improvements-for-asp-net-4-5-development.aspx). I've left the post in place below but much of what I said (particularly with regard to Hungarian Notation) I've now moved away from. That was originally my intention anyway so that's no bad thing. The one HN artefact that I've held onto is using "$" as a prefix for jQuery objects. I think that still makes sense. I would have written my first line of JavaScript in probably 2000. It probably looked something like this: `alert('hello world')`. I know. Classy. As I've mentioned before it was around 2010 before I took JavaScript in any way seriously. Certainly it was then when I started to actively learn the language. Because up until this point I'd been studiously avoiding writing any JavaScript at all I'd never really given thought to forms and conventions. When I wrote any JavaScript I just used the same style and approaches as I used in my main development language (of C#). By and large I have been following the .net naming conventions which are ably explained by Pete Brown [here](http://10rem.net/articles/net-naming-conventions-and-programming-standards
