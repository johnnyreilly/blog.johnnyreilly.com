I am excited to announce that a documentary has been made about TypeScript and it is coming out September 21st 2023! You can see a trailer for it below:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0btI_sXessI?si=6DMVgTsbd33ifMXB" title="TypeScript Origins trailer" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen></iframe>

I had the good fortune to be involved, in part thanks to my work on DefinitelyTyped. Another reason is my work on recording [the history of DefinitelyTyped](../2019-10-08-definitely-typed-the-movie/index.md).

When the documentary is released you will be able to find it on the [OfferZen Origins YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/offerzenorigins). When it goes out you'll have the chance to interact with some of the contributors (including myself) in a live chat.

I'm really looking forward to seeing how it turned out!
