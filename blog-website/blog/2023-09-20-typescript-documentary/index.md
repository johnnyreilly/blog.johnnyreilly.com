I am excited to announce that a documentary has been made about TypeScript! It premiered on YouTube at 5pm British Summertime September 21st 2023.

I had the good fortune to be involved in the making of the documentary. In part this was thanks to my work on Definitely Typed. Another reason was my work on recording [the history of DefinitelyTyped](../2019-10-08-definitely-typed-the-movie/index.md).

You can [see it on YouTube here](https://youtu.be/U6s2pdxebSo?si=Bw6scRpzmmSw5J2j) or hit play on the embedded video above. Thanks to the [Keyboard Stories](https://www.keyboard-stories.com/) team for making this happen!
