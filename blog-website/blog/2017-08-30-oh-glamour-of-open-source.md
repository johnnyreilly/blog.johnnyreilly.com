Here's how my life panned out in the early hours of Wednesday 30th September 2017:

 <dl><dt>2 am</dt><dd>awoken by Lisette having a nightmare</dd><dt>3 am</dt><dd>gave up hope of getting back to sleep upstairs and headed for the sofa</dd><dt>4 am</dt><dd>still not asleep and discovered a serious gap in an open source project I help out with</dd><dt>4:30 am</dt><dd> come up with idea for a fix</dd><dt>4:45 am</dt><dd> accidentally delete a repo that I and many others care about from GitHub</dd><dt>4:50 am</dt><dd> recover said repo from backups (sweet mercy how could I be so stupid?)</dd><dt>4:55 am</dt><dd> actually succeed in cloning the repo I want to hack on </dd><dt>5:30 am</dt><dd> implement fix and <a href="https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/pull/43">send PR</a></dd><dt>5:35 am</dt><dd> go for a walk round the river</dd><dt>6:30 am</dt><dd> realise I didn't submit a test for the changed functionality</dd><dt>6:35 am</dt><dd> write test only to discover I can't run the test pack on Windows</dd><dt>6:40 am</dt><dd> add test to PR anyway so I can see test results when Travis runs on each commit.</dd><dt>7 am</dt><dd>despair at the duration of my feedback loop, totally fail to get my tests to pass</dd><dt>7:10 am</dt><dd> stub my toe really badly on a train set Benjamin has been busily assembling beneath my feet</dd><dt>7:11 am</dt><dd> give in and literally beg the project owner in Paris to fix the tests for me. He takes pity on me and agrees. Possibly because I gave him emoji tulips ðŸŒ·</dd><dt>7:12 am</dt><dd> feel like a slight failure and profoundly tired.</dd></dl>

Oh the glamour of open source.
