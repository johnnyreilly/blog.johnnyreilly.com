I [blogged a little while ago around to support integration tests using Autofac](<https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2020/05/autofac-webapplicationfactory-and.html>). This was specific to Autofac but documented a workaround for a [long standing issue with `ConfigureTestContainer` that was introduced into .NET core 3.0](<https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14907>) which affects [all third-party containers](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-3.1#default-service-container-replacement>) that use `ConfigureTestContainer` in their tests.

I'll not repeat the contents of the previous post - it all still stands. However, with Autofac 6 the approach documented there will cease to work. This is because the previous approach relied upon `ContainerBuilder` not being sealed. [As of Autofac 6 it is.](<https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1120>)

Happily the tremendous [Alistair Evans](<https://twitter.com/evocationist>) came up with an [alternative approach](<https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1207#issuecomment-701961371>) which is listed below:

```cs
/// <summary>
    /// Based upon https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/test/integration-tests/samples/3.x/IntegrationTestsSample
    /// </summary>
    /// <typeparam name="TStartup"></typeparam>
    public class AutofacWebApplicationFactory<TStartup> : WebApplicationFactory<TStartup> where TStartup : class
    {
        protected override IHost CreateHost(IHostBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.UseServiceProviderFactory<ContainerBuilder>(new CustomServiceProviderFactory());
            return base.CreateHost(builder);
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Based upon https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14907#issuecomment-620750841 - only necessary because of an issue in ASP.NET Core
    /// </summary>
    public class CustomServiceProviderFactory : IServiceProviderFactory<ContainerBuilder>
    {
        private AutofacServiceProviderFactory _wrapped;
        private IServiceCollection _services;

        public CustomServiceProviderFactory()
        {
            _wrapped = new AutofacServiceProviderFactory();
        }

        public ContainerBuilder CreateBuilder(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            // Store the services for later.
            _services = services;

            return _wrapped.CreateBuilder(services);
        }

        public IServiceProvider CreateServiceProvider(ContainerBuilder containerBuilder)
        {
            var sp = _services.BuildServiceProvider();
#pragma warning disable CS0612 // Type or member is obsolete
            var filters = sp.GetRequiredService<IEnumerable<IStartupConfigureContainerFilter<ContainerBuilder>>>();
#pragma warning restore CS0612 // Type or member is obsolete

            foreach (var filter in filters)
            {
                filter.ConfigureContainer(b => { })(containerBuilder);
            }

            return _wrapped.CreateServiceProvider(containerBuilder);
        }        
    }
```

Using this in place of the previous approach should allow you continue running your integration tests with Autofac 6. Thanks Alistair!

 ## Concern for third-party containers

Whilst this gets us back up and running, [Alistair pointed out that this approach depends upon a deprecated interface](<https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1207#issuecomment-702250044>). This is the [`IStartupConfigureContainerFilter`](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.istartupconfigurecontainerfilter-1.configurecontainer?view=aspnetcore-3.1>) which [has been marked as `Obsolete` since mid 2019](<https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/11505>). What this means is, at some point, this approach will stop working.

The marvellous David Fowler has said that [`ConfigureTestContainer` issue should be resolved in .NET](<https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/1207#issuecomment-702361608>). However it's worth noting that this has been an issue since .NET Core 3 shipped and unfortunately the wonderful [Chris Ross has advised that it's not likely to be fixed for .NET 5](<https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14907#issuecomment-702287717>).

I'm very keen this does get resolved in .NET. Building tests upon an `Obsolete` attribute doesn't fill me with confidence. I'm a long time user of Autofac and I'd like to continue to be. Here's hoping that's made possible by a fix landing in .NET. If this is something you care about, it may be worth upvoting / commenting on [the issue in GitHub](<https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14907>) so the team are aware of desire around this being resolved.
