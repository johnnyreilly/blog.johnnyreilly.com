I've wanted to take a look at some of the alternative JavaScript runtimes for a while. The thing that has held me back is npm compatibility. I want to be able to run my code in a runtime that isn't Node.js and still be able to use npm packages. I've been using [ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/) for a long time now; it's what I reach for when I'm building any kind of console app. In this post I want to port a console app from ts-node to [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and see how easy it is.

## The ts-node app

I have a [technical blog](https://johnnyreilly.com/) which is built on Docusaurus. When the Docusaurus build completes, a post processing script runs to do things like:

- update the `sitemap.xml` to include the `lastmod` date based on [git commit date](https://johnnyreilly.com/docusaurus-createfeeditems-api-git-commit-date), and truncate the number of entries in the file
- patch the html files to use Cloudinary as an image CDN for open graph images

These scripts are implemented as a simple ts-node console app. For historical reasons it's called `trim-xml` (it originally just truncated the `sitemap.xml` file). It's not a particularly good name but I'm not going to change it now. As the blog is open source, you can see the [code of `trim-xml` here](https://github.com/johnnyreilly/blog.johnnyreilly.com/tree/main/trim-xml].

What we're interested in, is porting this app from ts-node to Bun. The app has a few dependencies; so npm compatibility is important to us. Let's see how it goes.

## Installing Bun

I installed Bun on my Ubuntu machine using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Which resulted in the following output:

```bash
bun was installed successfully to ~/.bun/bin/bun

Added "~/.bun/bin" to $PATH in "~/.zshrc"

To get started, run:

 exec /usr/bin/zsh
  bun --help
```

I was a little weirded out by the inconsistent indentation in the output but I'm sure that's just a formatting issue. (I submitted a [PR to fix this](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/2175).) When I ran the suggested commands it looked like bun was happy and healthy.

## Porting the install from yarn to bun

With bun in place I was ready to port the app. I opened up the (as I say, badly named) `trim-xml` directory and triggered installation of the dependencies using `bun install`:

```bash
cd trim-xml
bun install
```

Output looked like this:

```bash
bun install v0.5.7 (5929daee)
 + @types/node@18.14.1
 + fast-xml-parser@4.1.2
 + simple-git@3.16.1
 + typescript@4.9.5

 5 packages installed [2.34s]
```

As well, a new `bun.lockb` file had appeared in the directory alongside the `package.json`. Although I can't find any documentation on it, I'm guessing that this is the Bun equivalent of `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`. It's a binary file, so you can't read it. I did find this [project which allows you read bun.lockb files](https://github.com/JacksonKearl/bun-lockb) which looks like a useful way to solve that problem.

To avoid confusion, I also deleted the `yarn.lock` file. Yay - I've installed things! And pretty fast! What next?

## From `@types/node` to `bun/types`

As I looked at the output for the install I realised that the `@types/node` package had been installed. The `@types/node` package is a package that contains TypeScript definitions for the Node.js runtime. Given we're moving to using Bun, it seemed likely that I didn't need these. But I likely did need something that represented the Bun runtime types. (Which incidentally, I would imagine to be pretty similar to the Node.js runtime types.)

I had a quick look at the Bun documentation and found the [`bun/types`](https://oven-sh.github.io/bun-types/) package. I added it to my project, whilst removing `@types/node` and `ts-node`:

```bash
bun remove @types/node
bun remove ts-node
bun add bun-types
```

Output looked like this:

```bash
bun remove v0.5.7 (5929daee)
 - @types/node

 1 packages removed [3.00ms]
bun remove v0.5.7 (5929daee)
 - ts-node

 1 packages removed [843.00ms]
bun add v0.5.7 (5929daee)

 installed bun-types@0.5.7


 1 packages installed [1.97s]
```

The [docs also say](https://oven-sh.github.io/bun-types/#usage):

> Add this to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "compilerOptions": {
>     "lib": ["ESNext"],
>     "module": "esnext",
>     "target": "esnext",
>     // "bun-types" is the important part
>     "types": ["bun-types"]
>   }
> }
> ```

I aligned my existing `tsconfig.json` with the above. For my console app this meant the following changes:

```diff
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
-      "target": "ES2022",
+      "target": "esnext",
-      // "lib": [],
+      "lib": ["ESNext"],
-      "module": "NodeNext",
+      "module": "esnext",
-      // "types": [],
+      "types": ["bun-types"],
    },
  }
```

## `moduleResolution` with Bun

I'd imagined that at this point I'd be able to run the app, but when I navigated around in VS Code I saw that I had a bunch of errors. I was getting errors like this:

![screenshot of VS Code saying "Cannot find module 'fast-xml-parser'. Did you mean to set the 'moduleResolution' option to 'node', or to add aliases to the 'paths' option?ts(2792)"](screenshot-cannot-find-module.png)

The error message was suggesting I needed to explicitly state that I wanted to use the Node.js module resolution algorithm. Whilst we're using Bun, we're porting a Node app - so this made sense. So I made one more change to the `tsconfig.json` to satisy this:

```diff
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
-      // "moduleResolution": "node",
+      "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    },
  }
```

With that in place, the module resolution errors were... resolved. (Sorry.)

## File APIs with Bun

However, I was still getting errors. This time they were about the [`fs.promises` API](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promises-api). I was getting errors like this:

![screenshot of errors in VS Code reporting the absence of the fs.promises API](screenshot-file-apis.png)

It looked like the version of bun I was using didn't support that API. As I dug through my code I realised that I was using the `fs.promises` API in a few places. I was using it in the following ways:

- `await fs.promises.readdir`
- `await fs.promises.readFile`
- `await fs.promises.writeFile`

For `fs.promises.readFile` and `fs.promises.writeFile` I was able to replace them with the Bun equivalents [`Bun.file(path).text()`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/file-io#reading-files) and [`Bun.write(path, content)`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/file-io#writing-files) respectively:

```diff
- `await fs.promises.readFile`
+ `await Bun.file(path).text()`
- `await fs.promises.writeFile(path, content)`
+ `await Bun.write(path, content)`
```

There appeared to be no Bun equivalent for `fs.promises.readdir`, so I used the [sync Node.js API](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsreaddirsyncpath-options):

```diff
- `await fs.promises.readdir`
+ `fs.readdirSync(path)`
```

We now had code without any errors. (At least in VS Code as far as TypeScript was concerned. I had yet to run the app to see if it worked.)

### Clarification on `fs.promises`

I was tweeting about my findings as I wrote this, and [Jarred Sumner (who works on Bun) was kind enough to share](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1629818921904902145) that the `fs.promises` API is implemented but the types aren't as yet.

![Screenshot of exchange on Twitter with Jarred responding "it sort of exists, but looks like the types are out of date. I say sort of because, actually everything async is sync for node:fs and it just wraps in a Promise. If you use fs createReadStream / fs.createWriteStream or Bun.file(path).stream() itâ€™ll be concurrent / async"](screenshot-tweet-fs-promises-exists.png)

## Running the app

I now needed to do one more thing:

```diff
-    "start": "ts-node index.ts"
+    "start": "bun index.ts"
```

That's right; update the `start` script in `package.json` to use `bun` instead of `ts-node`. And now I was able to run the app with `bun start`:

```bash
Loading /home/john/code/github/blog.johnnyreilly.com/blog-website/build/sitemap.xml
Reducing 526 urls to 512 urls
```

The first positive thing about what I saw, was that we appeared to have running code. Yay! The program also appeared to be executing instantaneously, which seemed surprising. I was expecting Bun to be faster, but this seemed too fast.

Also, we seemed to be lacking many of the log messages I'd expect. I was expecting to see about 1000 log messages. Something wasn't right.

## Top level `await` and Bun

The issue was that my `main` function was asynchronous. However, because support for top level `await` wasn't available in Node.js when I originally wrote the code, I'd called the `main` function synchronously. Fortunately Node didn't complain about that, and the program behaved in the way required.

However Bun looked like it was respecting the fact that `main` was asynchronous. That's why it was apparently executing so quickly; it wasn't waiting for the `main` method to complete before terminating.

To be honest, Bun's behaviour here is just right; the code as is didn't suggest that it was interested in waiting for the `main` function to complete. But it turns out that waiting is exactly the desired behaviour. To bring things right, we could use top level `await`. So I made the following change to my `index.ts` file:

```diff
- main();
+ await main();
```

And now I was getting the expected log messages; and the program appeared to be working as expected.

## GitHub Actions and Bun

I was now able to run the app locally. But I wanted to run it in GitHub Actions. I just needed to add the `setup-bun` action to my workflow, so bun was available in the GitHub Actions environment:

```yaml
- name: Setup bun ðŸ”§
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
  with:
    bun-version: latest
```

## Performance comparison; Bun vs ts-node

I was expecting Bun to be faster than ts-node. Let's take a run of our app in GitHub Actions with ts-node and compare it to a run of our app with Bun:

### ts-node

```bash
Post processing finished in 17.09 seconds
Done in 19.52s.
```

### Bun

```bash
Post processing finished in 12.367 seconds
Done in 12.72s.
```

I haven't done any formal benchmarking, but it looks like Bun is about 50% faster than ts-node for this usecase. That's pretty good. It's also worth expanding on how this breaks down.

You'll notice in the logs above there's two log entries:

1. The "Post processing" reflects the time taken to run the `main` function.
2. The "Done" reflects the time taken to run the `bun` command end to end.

What can we learn from this? First of all, running code in ts-node takes 17 seconds, compared to 12 seconds with Bun. **So Bun is performing about 40% faster at running code.**

The end to end is 19 seconds with ts-node, compared to 14 seconds with Bun. **So Bun is performing about 50% faster end to end.** There's two parts to this; the time taken to compile the code and the time taken to start up. We're doing type checking with ts-node; which if deactivated would make a difference.

However, when you look at the difference between the end to end runtime and code runtime with Bun, it's a mere 0.353 seconds. ts-node clocks in at 2.43 seconds for the same. So ts-node is about 6.5 times slower at starting up. That's a pretty big difference; it's unlikely that all of this is TypeScript compilation; Node.js is fundamentally slower at getting going than Bun is.

## Conclusion

Moving from ts-node to Bun was a pretty easy process. I was able to do it in a few hours. I was able to run the app locally and in GitHub Actions. And I was able to run the app in less time.

This all makes me feel very positive about Bun. I'm looking forward to using it more in the future.
