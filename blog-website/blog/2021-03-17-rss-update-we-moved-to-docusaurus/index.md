My blog lived happily on [Blogger](https://icanmakethiswork.blogspot.com/) for the past decade. It's now built with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To understand the why, [read my last post](../2021-03-15-definitive-guide-to-migrating-from-blogger-to-docusaurus/index.md). This post serves purely to share details of feed updates for RSS / Atom subscribers.

<!--truncate-->

The Atom feed at this location no longer exists: https://johnnyreilly.com/feeds/posts/default

The following feeds are new and different:

- RSS - https://johnnyreilly.com/rss.xml
- Atom - https://johnnyreilly.com/atom.xml

The new format might mess with any feed reader you have set up. I do apologise for the friction; hopefully it shouldn't cause you too much drama.

Finally, all historic links should continue to work with the new site; redirects have been implemented.
