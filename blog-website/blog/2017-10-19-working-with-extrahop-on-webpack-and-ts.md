I'm quite proud of this: [https://www.extrahop.com/company/blog/2017/extrahop-webpack-accelerating-build-times/](https://www.extrahop.com/company/blog/2017/extrahop-webpack-accelerating-build-times/)

 If you didn't know, I spend a good amount of my spare time hacking on open source software. You may not know what that is. I would describe OSS as software made with ‚ù§ by people, for other people to use.

You are currently reading this on a platform that was built using OSS. It's all around you, every day. It's on your phone, on your computer, on your TV. It's everywhere.

It's my hobby, it's part of my work. This specifically was one of those tremendously rare occasions when I got paid directly to work on my hobby, with people much brighter than me. It was brilliant. I loved it; it was a privilege.

Here's to Open Source!
