A long time ago (well, 2012) in a galaxy far, far away (okay; Plovdiv, Bulgaria)....

[Definitely Typed](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) began!

This is a project that set out to provide type definitions for every JavaScript library that lacked them. An ambitious goal. Have you ever wondered what the story that lay behind it was?

Perhaps you know that the project was started by a shadowy figure named "Boris Yankov". And maybe you know that the TypeScript team is now part of the Definitely Typed team. There's a lot more to tell.

This autumn, I'd like to tell you the story of how Definitely Typed came to be what it is. From an individual commit in a repo that Boris created in 2012 to [the number 10 project by contributions on GitHub in 2018](https://octoverse.github.com/projects). I'm part of that story. Basarat Ali Syed is part of that story. Masahi Wakame too. Blake Embrey. Steve Fenton. Igor Oleinikov. It's an amazing and unexpected tale. One that turns upon the actions of individuals. They changed your life and I'd love you to learn how.

So, coming soon to a blog post near you, is the story of Definitely Typed. It's very exciting! Stay tuned...
