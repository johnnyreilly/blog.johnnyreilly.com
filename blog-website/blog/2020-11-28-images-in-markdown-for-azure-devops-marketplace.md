I've recently found myself developing [custom pipelines task extensions for Azure DevOps](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-build-task?view=azure-devops>). The extensions being developed end up in the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops>). What you see there when you look at existing extensions is some pretty lovely documentation.

## How can our tasks look as lovely?

That, my friends, is the question to answer. Good documentation is key to success. Here's the ask: when a custom task is installed it becomes available in the marketplace, we want it to:

- contain documentation
- that documentation should support images... For a picture, famously, speaks a thousand words

<!-- -->

## Mark(Down) our manifest

To get documentation showing up in the marketplace, we need to take a look at the `vss-extension.json` file which lies at the root of our extension folder. It's a kind of manifest file and is documented [here](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/manifest?view=azure-devops>).

[Tucked away in the docs, you'll find mention of a `content` property and the words:](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/manifest?view=azure-devops#discovery-attributes>)

> Dictionary of content files that describe your extension to users... Each file is assumed to be in [GitHub Flavored Markdown format](<https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/>). The path of each item is the path to the markdown file in the extension. Valid keys: `details`.

This means we can have a MarkDown file in our repo which documents our task. To stay consistent with most projects, a solid choice is to use the `README.md` that sits in the root of the project to this end.

So the simple addition of this:

```json
{
    //...
    "content": {
        "details": {
            "path": "README.md"
        }
    },
    //...
}
```

Gives us documentation in the marketplace. Yay!

## Now the images...

If we are referencing images in our `README.md` then, as it stands right now, they won't show up in the marketplace. It'll be broken link city. Imagine some MarkDown like this:

```md
![alt text](images/screenshot.png)
```

This is entirely correct and supported, but won't work by default. This is because these images need to be specified in the [`files` property](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/manifest?view=azure-devops#files>) of the `vss-extension.json`.

```json
{
    //...
    "content": {
        "details": {
            "path": "README.md"
        }
    },
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "images",
            "addressable": true
        }
    ]
    //...
}
```

Consider the above; the `path` of `images` includes everything inside the `images` folder in the task. However, it's crucial that the [`"addressable": true`](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/manifest?view=azure-devops#properties-1>) is present as well. It's this that makes the files in this `path` URL-addressable. And without that, the images won't be displayed.

That's it! We're done! We can have rich, image inclusive, documentation in our custom tasks.

A final note: it's possible to specify individual files rather than whole paths in the `files` directory and you might want to do that if you're being very careful around file size. There is a maximum size for a custom task and it's easy to breach it. But by and large I find that "allowlisting" a single directory is easier.
