I have an ASP.Net Core project that I build with VSTS. It is deployed to Azure through a CI / CD setup in VSTS. That part I'm happy with. Proud of even. Now to the sordid hiddenness: try as I might, I've never found a nice way to deploy Entity Framework database migrations as part of the deployment flow. So I have [blushes with embarrassment] been using the <code>Startup</code> of my ASP.Net core app to run the migrations on my database. There. I said it. You all know. Absolutely filthy.

<p>My expectation was that with webpack 4 and <code>'mode': 'production'</code> this meant that behind the scenes all <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> statements should be converted to <code>'production'</code>. Subsequently Uglify would automatically get its groove on with the resulting <code>if("production"!=="production") ...</code> and et voilà!... Strip the dead code.</p>
<p>It seemed that was not the case. I was seeing (regrettably) undead code.
