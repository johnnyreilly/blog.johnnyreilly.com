I grew up the 80's just outside London. For those of you of a different vintage let me paint a picture. These were the days when "Personal Computers", as they were then styled, were taking the world by storm. Every house would be equipped with either a ZX Spectrum, a Commodore 64 or an Amstrad CPC. These were 8 bit computers which were generally plugged into the family television and spent a good portion of their time loading games like <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target:_Renegade target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Target: Renegade</a> from an audio cassette. But not in our house; we didn't have a computer. I remember mournfully pedalling home from friends houses on a number of occasions, glum as I compared my lot with theirs. Whereas my friends would be spending their evenings gleefully battering their keyboards as they thrashed the life out of various end-of-level bosses I was reduced to *<strong>wasting</strong>* my time reading. That's right Enid Blyton - you were second best in my head. Then one happy day (and it may have been a Christmas present although I'm not certain) our family became the proud possessors of an <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Amstrad CPC 6128</a>:</p>

Sebastian wrote a blog post documenting a good solution to the ASP.NET JavaScriptSerializer DateTime problem at the tail end of last year. However, his solution didn't get me 100% of the way there when I tried to use it because of a need to support IE 8 which lead me to use Nathan Vonnahme's ISO 8601 JavaScript Date parser. I thought it was worth documenting this, hence this post, but just so I'm clear; the hard work here was done by Sebastian Markbåge and Nathan Vonnahme and not me.

If I'm honest, I hadn't given much consideration to the code quality of my JavaScript in the past. However, if I was going to make increasing use of it (and given the way the web is going at the moment I'd say that's a given) I didn't think this was tenable position to maintain. A friend of mine works for <a href=http://www.coverity.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Coverity</a> which is a company that provides tools for analysing code quality. I understand, from conversations with him, that their tools provide static analysis for compiled languages such as C++ / C# / Java etc. I was looking for something similar for JavaScript. Like many, I have read and loved <a href=http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good Parts"</a>; it is by some margin the most useful and interesting software related book I have read.So I was aware that Crockford had come up with his own JavaScript code quality tool called <a href=http://www.jslint.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">JSLint</a>. JSLint is quite striking when you first encounter it:</p>

I realise that in these wild and crazy days of <a href=http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF.js</a> and the like that techniques like this must seem very old hat. That said, this technique works and more importantly it solves a problem I was faced with but without forcing the users to move the "newest hottest version of X". Much as many of would love to solve problems this way, alas many corporations move slower than that and in the meantime we still have to deliver - we still have to meet requirements. Rather than just say "I did this" I thought I'd record how I got to this point in the first place.

<p>The speed of change makes fools of us all. Since I originally wrote this post all of 3 weeks ago Visual Studio 11 beta has been released and the issues I was seeking to solve have pretty much been resolved by the new innovations found therein. It's nicely detailed in <a href=http://www.twitter.com/carlbergenhem target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">@carlbergenhem</a>'s blog post: <a href=https://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/posts/12-03-26/my-top-5-visual-studio-11-designer-improvements-for-asp-net-4-5-development.aspx target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">My Top 5 Visual Studio 11 Designer Improvements for ASP.NET 4.5 Development</a>. I've left the post in place below but much of what I said (particularly with regard to Hungarian Notation) I've now moved away from. That was originally my intention anyway so that's no bad thing. The one HN artefact that I've held onto is using "$" as a prefix for jQuery objects. I think that still makes sense. I would have written my first line of JavaScript in probably 2000. It probably looked something like this: <code>alert('hello world')</code>. I know. Classy. As I've mentioned before it was around 2010 before I took JavaScript in any way seriously. Certainly it was then when I started to actively learn the language. Because up until this point I'd been studiously avoiding writing any JavaScript at all I'd never really given thought to forms and conventions. When I wrote any JavaScript I just used the same style and approaches as I used in my main development language (of C#). By and large I have been following the .net naming conventions which are ably explained by Pete Brown <a href=http://10rem.net/articles/net-naming-conventions-and-programming-standards---best-practices target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Over time I have started to move away from this approach. Without a deliberate intention to do so I have found myself adopting a different style for my JavaScript code as compared with anything else I write. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm completely happy with the style I'm currently using. But I find it more helpful than not and thought it might be worth talking about. It was really 2 things that started me down the road of "rolling my own" convention: dynamic typing and the lack of safety nets. Let's take each in turn....</div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class=tag_QGVx><a title="The JavaScript programming language." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href=/tags/javascript>JavaScript</a></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Striving for (JavaScript) Convention" href=/striving-for-javascript-convention><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class=margin-bottom--xl><header><h2 class=title_f1Hy><a href=/jquery-unobtrusive-remote-validation>jQuery Unobtrusive Remote Validation</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime=2012-03-03T00:00:00.000Z>March 3, 2012</time> · <!-- -->9 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href=https://johnnyreilly.com/about target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class=avatar__photo-link><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src=https://johnnyreilly.com/img/profile.jpg alt="John Reilly"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class=avatar__name><a href=https://johnnyreilly.com/about target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=authorName_yefp>John Reilly</span></a></div><small class=authorTitle_nd0D title="OSS Engineer - TypeScript, Azure, React, Node.js, .NET">OSS Engineer - TypeScript, Azure, React, Node.js, .NET</small><div class=authorSocials_rSDt></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class=markdown><p>Just recently I have been particularly needing to make use of remote / server-side validation in my ASP.NET MVC application and found that the unobtrusive way of using this seemed to be rather inadequately documented (of course it's possible that it's well documented and I just didn't find the resources).
