href="/teams-notification-webhooks">sending Teams notifications using a webhook</a>, and it&#x27;s a technique I&#x27;ve used a lot. But I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to send a direct message to a user, and that&#x27;s not possible with the webhook approach. I work with a marvellous fellow named Chris Tacey-Green, and he&#x27;s figured out a way to do this using Power Automate and the Teams Notification API. I&#x27;m going to describe how he did it here, with a little help from him.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s probably worth saying, both Chris and I work for Investec, and we&#x27;re going to share some of the things we&#x27;ve learned about using Teams and Power Automate in the hope that it&#x27;s useful to others. But we&#x27;re not speaking on behalf of Investec, and we&#x27;re not suggesting that this is the best way to do things. This is likely in the &quot;do things that do not scale&quot; category. Significantly though, it works!</p>
<p>You will see some screenshots of our internal Teams environment, but we&#x27;ve tried to keep them to a minimum, and we&#x27;re not going to share any sensitive information.</p>

This post goes a little further and talks about how to use Structured Data with Docusaurus and MDX. More specifically it looks at how to create a component that both renders FAQs into a page, and the same information as Structured Data.</p>

<p>This is down to the fact that Bash arrays when used with the Azure CLI can be a little surprising. If we initialise a single item array then it&#x27;s not an array. It&#x27;s a string. This is a bit of a pain when you&#x27;re trying to pass a single item array to a Bicep template. It&#x27;s possible to work around this with JSON and Bicep user defined types. Let&#x27;s see how.</p>
