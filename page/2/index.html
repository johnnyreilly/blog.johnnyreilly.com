The Material-UI (MUI) library provides a <a href=https://mui.com/x/react-tree-view/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">treeview component</a> that is very useful. However, some of the default behaviours of the component differ from that which you typically find in a treeview component. I'm speaking, of course, about node selection. I'm used to a treeview component that, when a parent node is selected, auto selects the child nodes underneath. And by turn, when nodes are deselected, the parent nodes get deselected.</p>
<p>This post documents how to implement this behaviour with the MUI treeview component.</p>
<p>Since initially writing this, I've learned that it is likely that the kind of behaviour I'm hand-rolling here, will natively land in the component. So, all being well, what follows should become unnecessary! To track native support <a href=https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/12883 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">watch this GitHub issue</a>.</p>

Maybe it needs to be approved by someone, maybe you need an explicit record of what method is to be executed.</p>
<p>Now you could build a mechanism to manually cater for each scenario that triggered a method call. But that's a lot of boilerplate code for each implementation, and given we might want to cater for many scenarios, it wouldn't scale particularly well as an approach.</p>
<p>So how can we take a method call, serialise it, perhaps store it in a database, and then later rehydrate and execute?</p>

<p>That's right, you just use a newline character. It's that simple. Oddly, searching for that on the internet didn't yield the answer I was looking for. So I'm writing it down here for posterity.</p>
<p>With your <code>.env</code> file in place, you can then consume it in your application using a package like <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>dotenv</code></a>.

I like to avoid leaving unused variables in my code; these compiler options help me do that.</p>
<p>I use ESLint alongside TypeScript. The <a href=https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-unused-vars target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>no-unused-vars</code></a> rule provides similar functionality to TypeScripts <code>noUnusedLocals</code> and <code>noUnusedParameters</code> settings, but has more power and more flexibility. For instance, <code>no-unused-vars</code> can catch unused error variables; TypeScript's <code>noUnusedLocals</code> and <code>noUnusedParameters</code> cannot.</p>
<p>One thing that I missed when switching to the ESLint option is that, with <code>noUnusedLocals</code> and <code>noUnusedParameters</code>, you can simply ignore unused variables by prefixing a variable with the <code>_</code> character. That's right, sometimes I want to declare a variable that I know I'm not going to use, and I want to do that without getting shouted at by the linter.</p>
<p>It turns out you can get ESLint to respect the TypeScript default of ignoring variables prefixed with <code>_</code>; <a href=https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8464#issuecomment-1943325441 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">it's just not the default configuration for <code>no-unused-vars</code></a>. But with a little configuration we can have it. This post is a quick guide to how to implement that configuration.</p>

It's a great way to ensure that your bicep files conform to best practices. Interestingly, when the linting feature first shipped, there wasn't an explicit lint command as part of the CLI. Instead, you had to run <code>bicep build</code> and it would run the linter as part of the build process. This was a little confusing as it was not obvious that the linter was running.</p>
<p>As of <a href=https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/tag/v0.21.1 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">version 0.21.1</a> there is a dedicated <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/linter target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>bicep lint</code></a> command. This is a nice step forwards; it allows you to explicitly lint your your code, rather than have it happen as a side effect of build. And it is useful if you want to run the linter as part of a CI/CD pipeline. What's more the <code>bicep lint</code> command is now available in the Azure CLI as well. You can run <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/bicep?view=azure-cli-latest#az-bicep-lint" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>az bicep lint</code></a> to lint your bicep files.</p>

The easier it is to write tests, the more likely they'll be written. I've long loved snapshot testing for this reason. Snapshot testing takes away the need to manually write verification code in your tests. Instead, you write tests that compare the output of a call to your method with JSON serialised output you've generated on a previous occasion. This approach takes less time to write, less time to maintain, and the solid readability of JSON makes it more likely you'll pick up on bugs. It's so much easier to scan JSON than it is a list of assertions.</p>
<p>Loving snapshot testing as I do, I want to show you how to write high quality and low effort log assertions using snapshot testing. The behaviour of logging code is really important; it's this that we tend to rely upon when debugging production issues. But how do you test logging code? Well, you could write a bunch of assertions that check how your logger is used. But that's a lot of work, it's not super readable and it's not fun. (Always remember: if it's not fun, you're doing it wrong.)</p>
<p>Instead, we'll achieve this using snapshot testing.</p>

<p>This is a follow up to my <a href=/how-i-ruined-my-seo>"How I ruined my SEO"</a> post. That was about how my site stopped ranking in Google's search results around October 2022. This post is about how <a href=https://growtika.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Growtika</a> and I worked together to fix it.</p>
<p>As we'll see, the art of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) is a mysterious one. We made a number of changes that we believe helped. All told, my site spent about a year out in the cold - barely surfacing in search results. But in October 2023 it started ranking again. And it's been ranking ever since.</p>
<p>I put that down to the assistance rendered by Growtika. What was the nature of that assistance? I'll tell you. This post is a biggie; so buckle up!</p>
