So I did, and this is it.</p>
<p>I named it "Definitely Typed: The Movie" as the name entertained me. Little did I know, that a few years later, a documentary would be made about TypeScript, and I'd be in it; in part thanks to writing this history. You can see <a href=/typescript-documentary>more about that here</a>.</p>
