<p>My expectation was that with webpack 4 and <code>&#x27;mode&#x27;: &#x27;production&#x27;</code> this meant that behind the scenes all <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> statements should be converted to <code>&#x27;production&#x27;</code>. Subsequently Uglify would automatically get its groove on with the resulting <code>if(&quot;production&quot;!==&quot;production&quot;) ...</code> and et voilà!... Strip the dead code.</p>
