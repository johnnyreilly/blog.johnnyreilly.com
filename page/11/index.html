<p>My expectation was that with webpack 4 and <code>'mode': 'production'</code> this meant that behind the scenes all <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> statements should be converted to <code>'production'</code>. Subsequently Uglify would automatically get its groove on with the resulting <code>if("production"!=="production") ...</code> and et voilà!... Strip the dead code.</p>
<p>It seemed that was not the case. I was seeing (regrettably) undead code.

<p>Whilst things did improve by fiddling with Windows Defender it wasn't a 100% fix which makes me wary. Interestingly, VS Code was always open when I did experience the issue and I haven't experienced it when it's been closed. So it may be the cause. I've opened <a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28593 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">an issue for this against the VS Code repo</a> - it sounds like other people may be affected as I was. Perhaps this is VS Code and not Windows Defender. Watch that space...</p>

<p>The issue was VS Code. The bug has now been fixed and shipped last night with <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code 1.14.0</a>.
