For there is a new hope; it's called <a href=https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome Headless </a>. It's not a separate version of Chrome; rather the ability to run Chrome without a UI is now baked into Google's favourite browser as of v59. (For those history buffs I might as well be clear: the main reason PhantomJS died is because Chrome Headless was in the works.)</div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class=tag_QGVx><a title="How to perform the automation of tests." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href=/tags/automated-testing>Automated Testing</a></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Karma: From PhantomJS to Headless Chrome" href=/karma-from-phantomjs-to-headless-chrome><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class=margin-bottom--xl><header><h2 class=title_f1Hy><a href=/a-haiku-on-problem-with-semver-us>A Haiku on the Problem with SemVer: Us</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime=2017-07-29T00:00:00.000Z>July 29, 2017</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href=https://johnnyreilly.com/about target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class=avatar__photo-link><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src=https://johnnyreilly.com/img/profile.jpg alt="John Reilly"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class=avatar__name><a href=https://johnnyreilly.com/about target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=authorName_yefp>John Reilly</span></a></div><small class=authorTitle_nd0D title="OSS Engineer - TypeScript, Azure, React, Node.js, .NET">OSS Engineer - TypeScript, Azure, React, Node.js, .NET</small><div class=authorSocials_rSDt></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class=markdown><p>Version numbers wrong

<p>Whilst things did improve by fiddling with Windows Defender it wasn't a 100% fix which makes me wary. Interestingly, VS Code was always open when I did experience the issue and I haven't experienced it when it's been closed. So it may be the cause. I've opened <a href=https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28593 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">an issue for this against the VS Code repo</a> - it sounds like other people may be affected as I was. Perhaps this is VS Code and not Windows Defender. Watch that space...</p>
