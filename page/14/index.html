<p>Every now and then something bites you unexpectedly. After a certain amount of pain, the answer comes to you and you know you want to save others from falling into the same deathtrap.</p>
<p>There I was minding my own business and having a play with a Gulp plugin called <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-angular-templatecache target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">gulp-angular-templatecache</a>. If you're not aware of it, it "Concatenates and registers AngularJS templates in the $templateCache". I was planning to use it so that all the views in an <a href=https://github.com/johnnyreilly/proverb-offline target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular app of mine</a> were loaded up-front rather than on demand. (It's a first step in making an "offline-first" version of that particular app.)</div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class=tag_QGVx><a title="The Visual Studio IDE." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href=/tags/visual-studio>Visual Studio</a><li class=tag_QGVx><a title="The Node.js runtime." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href=/tags/node-js>Node.js</a></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Gulp, npm, long paths and Visual Studio....
