But let's pull back a bit. Let's start with the JavaScript Object Literal. Some years ago I came upon this article by Christan Heilmann about the JavaScript Object Literal which had been published all the way back in 2006: ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://christianheilmann.com/2006/02/16/show-love-to-the-object-literal/",children:"Show love to the JavaScript Object Literal"})," Now when I read this it was a revelation to me. I hadn't really used JavaScript objects a great deal at this point (yes I am one of those people that started using JavaScript without actually learning the thing) and when I had used them is was through the ",(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"var obj = new Object()"})," pattern (as that's the only approach I knew).

Henceforth I adopted this approach in my code as I'm generally a believer that brevity is best. It was sometime later that I happened upon JSON (when I started looking into ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/jqgrid-its-just-far-better-grid",children:"jqGrid"}),"). Basically I was looking to pass complex data structures backward and forward to the server and, as far as I knew, there was no way to achieve this simply in JavaScript. I was expecting that I would have to manually serialise and deserialise (yes dammit I will use the English spellings!) objects when ever I wanted to do this sort of thing. However, I was reading the the fantastic Dave Ward's ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://encosia.com/",children:"Encosia"})," blog which on this occasion was talking about the ",(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://encosia.com/why-aspnet-ajax-updatepanels-are-dangerous/",children:"troubles of UpdatePanels"})," (a subject close to my heart by the way) and more interestingly the use of PageMethods in ASP.NET.

JSON, from my perspective, turned out to be a simple way to turn an object into a string and then from a string back into an object.
