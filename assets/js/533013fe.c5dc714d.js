That said, this technique works and more importantly it solves a problem I was faced with but without forcing the users to move the "newest hottest version of X". Much as many of would love to solve problems this way, alas many corporations move slower than that and in the meantime we still have to deliver - we still have to meet requirements. Rather than just say "I did this" I thought I\'d record how I got to this point in the first place. I don\'t know about you but I find the reasoning behind why different technical decisions get made quite an interesting topic...']})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(m,{...e})}):m(e)}},73030:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/making-pdfs-from-html-in-c-using","editUrl":"https://github.com/johnnyreilly/blog.johnnyreilly.com/edit/main/blog-website/blog/2012-04-05-making-pdfs-from-html-in-c-using/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2012-04-05-making-pdfs-from-html-in-c-using/index.md","title":"Making PDFs from HTML in C# using WKHTMLtoPDF","description":"Create PDF reports from HTML with WKHTMLtoPDF, an open source tool that renders web pages to PDF, using a simple wrapper class.","date":"2012-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"C#","permalink":"/tags/csharp","description":"The C# programming language."}],"readingTime":8.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"John Reilly","title":"OSS Engineer - TypeScript, Azure, React, Node.js, .NET","url":"https://johnnyreilly.com/about","imageURL":"https://johnnyreilly.com/img/profile.jpg","key":"johnnyreilly","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"making-pdfs-from-html-in-c-using","title":"Making PDFs from HTML in C# using WKHTMLtoPDF","authors":"johnnyreilly","tags":["c#"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"description":"Create PDF reports from HTML with WKHTMLtoPDF, an open source tool that renders web pages to PDF, using a simple wrapper class."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A Simple Technique for Initialising Properties with Internal Setters for Unit Testing","permalink":"/simple-technique-for-initialising"},"nextItem":{"title":"WCF - moving from Config to Code, a simple WCF service harness (plus implementing your own Authorization)","permalink":"/wcf-moving-from-config-to-code-simple"}}')}}]);
