I had a situation where I was working on an MVC project and needed to build up quite large objects within JavaScript representing various models. The models in question were already implemented on the server side using classes and made extensive use of inheritance because many of the properties were shared between the various models. That is to say we would have models which were implemented through the use of a class inheriting a base class which in turn inherits a further base class. With me? Good. Perhaps I can make it a little clearer with an example. Here are my 3 classes.

There\'s a million JavaScript libraries that facilitate this and after some experimentation I finally settled on ',(0,i.kt)("a",a({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js"}),"higgins")," implementation as it's simple and I saw a ",(0,i.kt)("a",a({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://jsperf.com/pubsubjs-vs-jquery-custom-events/11"}),"JSPerf")," which demonstrated it as either the fastest or second fastest in class. Up until now my main use for it had been to facilitate loosely coupled GUI interactions. If I wanted one component on the screen to influence anothers behaviour I simply needed to get the first component to publish out the relevant events and the second to subscribe to these self-same events. One of the handy things about publishing out events this way is that with them you can also include data. This data can be useful when driving the response in the subscribers. However, it occurred to me that it would be equally possible to pass an object when publishing an event.

It's not rock solid secure as it's always possible that someone could subscribe to your events and get access to your object as you published out.

Obviously the example I've given above it somewhat naive - in reality my object properties are driven by GUI components rather than hard-coded. But I hope this illustrates the point. This technique allows you to simply share functionality between different JavaScript files and so keep your codebase tight.
