I grew up the 80's just outside London. For those of you of a different vintage let me paint a picture. These were the days when \"Personal Computers\", as they were then styled, were taking the world by storm. Every house would be equipped with either a ZX Spectrum, a Commodore 64 or an Amstrad CPC. These were 8 bit computers which were generally plugged into the family television and spent a good portion of their time loading games like ",(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target:_Renegade",children:"Target: Renegade"})," from an audio cassette. But not in our house; we didn't have a computer. I remember mournfully pedalling home from friends houses on a number of occasions, glum as I compared my lot with theirs.
