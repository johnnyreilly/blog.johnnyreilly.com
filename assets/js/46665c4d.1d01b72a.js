Union types are being ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/543598#PostDetailsCell_1239340"},"discussed at present")," but in TypeScript v1.0 world the only viable approach is returning the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"any")," type. This implies ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"val()")," returns any possible JavaScript value from ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"boolean")," to ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Function")," and straight on 'til morning. So clearly this isn't accurate but importantly it also allows for the possibility of ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"val()")," returning ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"string"),", ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"number")," or ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"string[]"),"."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"The final getter typing with JSDoc applied ends up looking like this:"),(0,a.kt)("pre",null,(0,a.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-ts"},"/**\n     * Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements.\n     */\n    val(): any;\n")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"As you can see the ",(0,a.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"Get the current value..."')," from the API docs has been used as the overarching Intellisense that is displayed for the getter."),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"4-the-function-setter"},"4.
