If I'm honest, I hadn't given much consideration to the code quality of my JavaScript in the past. However, if I was going to make increasing use of it (and given the way the web is going at the moment I'd say that's a given) I didn't think this was tenable position to maintain. A friend of mine works for ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.coverity.com/"},"Coverity")," which is a company that provides tools for analysing code quality. I understand, from conversations with him, that their tools provide static analysis for compiled languages such as C++ / C# / Java etc. I was looking for something similar for JavaScript.

JSLint is quite striking when you first encounter it:"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,(0,r.kt)("img",{loading:"eager",fetchpriority:"high",src:n(21613).Z,width:"320",height:"192"})),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"It's the \"Warning! JSLint will hurt your feelings.\" that grabs you. And it's not wrong. I've copied and pasted code that I've written into JSLint and then gasped at the reams of errors JSLint would produce. I subsequently tried JSLint-ing various well known JS libraries (jQuery etc) and saw that JSLint considered they were thoroughly problematic as well. This made me feel slightly better. It was when I started examining some of the \"errors\" JSLint reported that I took exception. Yes, I took exception to exceptions! (I'm ","*",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"very"),"*"," pleased with that!)

Which is no bad thing. Many of Crockfords opinions are clearly worth their salt. It's just I didn't want all of them enforced upon me. As you can see above most of these \"problems\" are essentially complaints about a different style rather than bugs or potential issues. Now there are options in JSLint that you can turn on and off which looked quite promising. But before I got to investigating them I heard about ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.jshint.com"},"JSHint"),", brainchild of Anton Kovalyov and Paul Irish. In their own words: ",(0,r.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"JSHint is a fork of JSLint, the tool written and maintained by Douglas Crockford.

The icing on my cake would have been a plug-in for Visual Studio which would allow me to evaluate my JS files from within my IDE. Happily the world seems to be full of developers doing good turns for one another.

Fantastic! With this extension in play you could add JavaScript static code analysis to your compilation process and so learn of all the issues in your code at the same time, whether they lay in C# or JS or ","[insert language here]",'. You could control how JS problems were reported; as warnings, errors etc. You could straightforwardly exclude files from evaluation (essential if you\'re reliant on a number of 3rd party JS libraries which you are not responsible for maintaining). You could cater for predefined variables; allow for jQuery or DOJO. You could simply evaluate a single file in your solution by right clicking it and hitting the "JS Lint" option in the context menu. And it was simplicity itself to activate and deactivate the JSHint / JSLint extension as required.

For my part though I think JSHint is the more pragmatic and useful tool and likely to be the one I stick with.
