The first hurdle I fell at was getting the tests to run locally. The tests had first been developed on a standard desktop build and, as much as this can ever be said of Coded UI tests, they worked. However, the future had happened. The company in question was no longer using the old school desktop towers.

The reason they fell over at this point didn\u2019t become clear for a while. It wasn\u2019t until we tried tweaking our implementation of the tests that we realised what was happening. The tests normally found buttons / dropdowns etc on the screen and then attempted to perform a ",(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Mouse.Click"})," upon them.
