That said, this technique works and more importantly it solves a problem I was faced with but without forcing the users to move the "newest hottest version of X". Much as many of would love to solve problems this way, alas many corporations move slower than that and in the meantime we still have to deliver - we still have to meet requirements. Rather than just say "I did this" I thought I\'d record how I got to this point in the first place. I don\'t know about you but I find the reasoning behind why different technical decisions get made quite an interesting topic...']})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(m,{...e})}):m(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>a});var i=n(96540);const o={},s=i.createContext(o);function r(e){const t=i.useContext(s);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:r(e.components),i.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
