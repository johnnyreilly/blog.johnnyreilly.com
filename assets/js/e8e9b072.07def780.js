But what I know now is that I barely understood the language at all. All the JavaScript I knew was the result of copying and pasting after I'd hit \"view source\". I don't feel too bad about this - not because my ignorance was laudable but because I certainly wasn't alone in this. It seems that up until recently hardly anyone knew anything about JavaScript. It puzzles me now that I thought this was okay. I suppose like many people I didn't think JavaScript was capable of much and hence felt time spent researching it would be wasted.
